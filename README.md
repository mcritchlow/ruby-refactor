# ruby-refactor package

Select a region of text and invoke the :extract-to-method (ctrl-alt-e). You'll be prompted for a method name and a new argument list. If your extracted method does not take parameters, leave it empty. The method will be created above the method you are in with the method contents being the selected region. The region will be replaced with a call to method.
